# OllieTheCat
<pre>
Ollie the cat is a game made solely in Python using the Pygame library only in portuguese.
The project was done as a term paper for the first semester of the digital games technology college, the work was done in a group where I took on the position of Manager and programmer.
the project was not properly completed.
you need a python compiller to run the game, the game is not an executable.
